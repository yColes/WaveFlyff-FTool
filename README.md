I made a new F-Tool because i got sick of the other one.

Things that this tool does differently from the current one:
- is only a tool for spamming (the other one has things like collector and buffer and stuff. idk if any1 even uses those, i certainly never did)
- Setting of a F-Bar is not required so it wont spam your chat while using it (although it can if you want it to)
- Hotkeys for enabling and disabling a spammer (Shift + F1 for the first spammer... etc.)
- delay is set in milliseconds instead of full seconds.

Things that will maybe be coming one day (or not):
- setting custom hotkeys

How to use:
1. Find out the process name of the flyff client (usually Neuz) and put that into the process_name.txt
2. Run as admin
3. Set your keys however you need them and select your instance of the client.
4. Use Shift + F-Key to enable/disable the spammer.
